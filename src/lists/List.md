## Linked List

In computer science, a l [inked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.
