# Arrays

In computer science, an [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key.

## QuickSort

[Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm. Mathematical analysis of quicksort shows that, on average, the algorithm takes O(n log n) comparisons to sort n items. In the worst case, it makes O(n2) comparisons, though this behavior is rare.

## MergeSort

In computer science, [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm.

## BubbleSort O(1) space 0(n2) time

[Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) , sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort. Bubble sort can be practical if the input is in mostly sorted order with some out-of-order elements nearly in position.
