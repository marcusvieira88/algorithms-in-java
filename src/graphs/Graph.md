# Graph

A [graph data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges (also called links or lines), and for a directed graph are also known as arrows.

# Graph Search or Graph Traversal

In computer science, [graph traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_traversal) (also known as graph search) refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph.

### Depth-first search

A depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing a finite graph. DFS visits the child vertices before visiting the sibling vertices.

### Breadth-first search

A breadth-first search (BFS) is another technique for traversing a finite graph. BFS visits the sibling vertices before visiting the child vertices, and a queue is used in the search process.
